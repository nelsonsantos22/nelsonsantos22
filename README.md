<p><i>"It's never too late to be great."</i></p>
<p>From a social communication graduation to the tech world.</p>
<p>Technology was always something that has driven me and after spending years feeling unfulfilled professionally I stepped up and decided to take a leap of faith and engage in a world that has always fascinated me.
From that moment on, I have been learning new programming languages, technologies and how development works.
